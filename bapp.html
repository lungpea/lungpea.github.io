        <title>Projects: Bapp</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="projectdetails">
            <h1>Bapp</h1>
            <p>Bapp was the first project I fully designed and developed, submitted as my final project for CS50. It marked the beginning of my journey as a software developer.</p>
            <p>
                Bapp is a web app that allows users to manage their budgets based on customizable categories. It compares their set budgets for each month to their actual spending, 
                all represented on the home page by two intuitive graphs: one showing how much of the budget each category consumes, and the other illustrating how current spending 
                aligns with the set budget. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed Bapp using Python and the Django framework, aiming to learn a new technology while designing an intuitive and visually appealing solution to budget management.
                 The idea stemmed from a real-world need to track and adjust spending for myself and my girlfriend, creating a tool I believed she would appreciate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began by reading the Django documentation, which includes a simple tutorial guiding users through the creation of a poll app. From there, I progressed to writing
                basic page rendering and integrated Django’s built-in authentication module and models to quickly create secure and functional registration and login pages. 
                Django’s ability to use Python objects to create, modify, and interact with the database provided a safer and more intuitive way to manage this aspect of the project.
            </p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="./static/images/bapplogin.png" alt="" >
            </div>
            <p>
                Onward I learned to use Django's form API as well as their urls dispatcher. Overall the proccess was very straight forward as the documentation is very complete and
                detailed. The whole page development was a great learning experience as I made myself even more familiar with Python and modules like datetime and pytz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through alot of trial and error I managed to implemented the transaction display and insertion, which can accept bank provided .csv files or manual input,
                a budget management page that allows the creation/edition of categories as well as customization of their budget and display color on the graph, a history page 
                that records any changes made and finally an account page that allows you to change account information as well as the preferred language and currency, which 
                use cookies.
            </p>
            <div class="screenshots">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="./static/images/bappupload.png" alt="" >
                <img class="thumbnail" src="./static/images/bapptransactions.png" alt="" >
                <img class="thumbnail" src="./static/images/bappcategories.png" alt="" >
                <img class="thumbnail" src="./static/images/bapphistory.png" alt="" >

            </div>
            <p>
                Now I wanted to display graphs with the information, so after some looking around I decided to go with the Chart.js javascript library which at first seemed daunting,
                but after some fiddling I got the data to display as intended and found it to actually be very straightforward. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="screenshots">
                <img class="thumbnail" src="./static/images/bappgraph.png" >
            </div>

            <p>
                This marked the completion of my first project (after a ton of extra debugging and tweaking), a fun and rewarding assignement  that marks the begining of my developer
                journey. I found Django to be very welcoming and well documented, I hope I'll get to work more with it in the future.
