            <h1>Bapp</h1>
            <p>Bapp was the first project that I fully designed and developed, submited as my final project for CS50, marking the begining of my journey as a software dev</p>
            <p>
                Bapp is a web app that allows users to manage their budgets based on customizable categories, and compares their set budgets for each month to their spendings,
                all of this represented in the home page by two nifty graphs, one displaying how much of their budget each category takes and the other how their current spendings
                fit within their set budget. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to develop Bapp using Python and the Django framework, my goal being to learn a new technology, fully designing an intuitive and appealing solution to
                budget management as I found it best. The idea came from the real world problem of wanting to visualize mine and my girlfriend's spendings so we could adjust them,
                all in a way I thought my girlfriend would apreciate.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began by reading the Django documentation, which has a very simple tutorial to help you get started by which you are guided to develop a poll app.
                Afterwards I moved on to writing basic page rendering and incorporated Djangos built in auth module and models to quickly make a safe and effective
                registration and login pages. Django allows you to use python objects to create, modify and interact with your database, which allowed for even an more verbal
                and safe way to manage this side of the project.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Onward I learned to use Django's form API as well as their urls dispatcher. Overall the proccess was very straight forward as the documentation is very complete and
                detailed. The whole page development was a great learning experience as I made myself even more familiar with Python and modules like datetime and pytz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through alot of trial and error I managed to implemented the transaction display and insertion, which can accept bank provided .csv files or manual input,
                a budget management page that allows the creation/edition of categories as well as customization of their budget and display color on the graph, a history page 
                that records any changes made and finally an account page that allows you to change account information as well as the preferred language and currency, which 
                use cookies.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Now I wanted to display graphs with the information, so after some looking around I decided to go with the chartJS javascript library which at first seemed daunting,
                but after some fiddling I got the data to display as intended and found it to actually be very straightforward.
